    <h1>Pokewar</h1>
    <p>For this post I would Like to talk about a Gamejam called the TTRPG PokeJam
<hr> You see, I created a rulebook for a TTRPG called Pokewar. <a href = https://jov516.itch.io/pokewar> Which you may find here.</a> 
<br>This was a concept in which people could roleplay in the <strong>Pokemon</strong> universe during the time period of a war that is hinted about in the actual game lore.

<br>At the time I was always wondering how it would be to be in that world, and found the concept fun, but too light. 
<br> The original Pokemon Manga does touch on darker topics, but I wanted a means to roleplay out the world in a true setting with friends. 
<br>This contest was just a means for me to be able to express it and potentally allow others to have fun with it. 
<br>I find it <strong><em>funny</em></strong> how we recently have seen a game marketed as a pokemon like game with guns has recently taken off and gotten very popular, when the TTRPG idea I created would have been able to support that <strong>exact</strong> idea in a roleplay setting. 
<hr>Overall there is no connection, as I am sure the idea of living in the world with a darker undertone has been around since the conception of Pokemon, I just find it an interesting result of time showing the interests of people.
<br>My talented fiance created the artwork for the cover of the work, but with only a week to create the document (<em> I discovered it later into the GameJam and joined on a whim</em>) I didn't flush it out enough to get a high placing rank in the contest. 
<br>Of the <strong>9</strong> contestants, I was <strong>8th</strong>. Which wasn't last! 
<br>I feel like I could have made it better and easier to understand, but I am still glad I put myself out there to be critiqued by other creators. 
<br>Even if I didn't succeed in my endevors.
<hr>Here is an image from Palworld to show how jarring it really is to see cute animal like creatures with guns.</p>
